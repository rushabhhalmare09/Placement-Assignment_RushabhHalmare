Hi how are you
Can a Commerce PG person can move to DS?
I am 34 yaer old mechanical engineer having 8 year industrial experience.<br>Will recruiter interested to hire me after completing inuron course?
If one is not B.E/B.Tech then rarely any one gets chance as  a data scientist.
really nice
If I got marurcs right you went Python &gt; Stats &gt; Maths &gt; NLP and job right ?
Mechanical engineering is also technical it can not be non tech to tech
